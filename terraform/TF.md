## Terraform practices

* #### Isolate environment

Create resources with different name for each environment and each resource.

* #### Avoid hard coding the resources

* #### Use shared modules

* #### Keep Your Backends Small

* #### Use one state per environment

Breaking down by envioronment reduces risk when you apply changes.
