## Python (web) practices

* #### Use Virtual Environments

You should create a virtual environment for each project you create.
This will avoid any library clashes, since different projects may need different versions of a certain library.

* #### Flask

Flask implements only the most commonly-used core components of a web application framework so it is an excellent choice for building smaller applications, APIs, and web services.

* #### WSGI

The Web Server Gateway Interface (or “WSGI” for short) is a standard interface between web servers and Python web application frameworks. By standardizing behavior and communication between web servers and Python web frameworks, WSGI makes it possible to write portable Python web code.

* #### Nginx

web server and reverse-proxy for HTTP, SMTP, and other protocols. It is known for its high performance, relative simplicity, and compatibility with many application servers.

* #### Server Best Practices

The majority of self-hosted Python applications today are hosted with a WSGI server such as Gunicorn, either directly or behind a lightweight web server such as nginx. The WSGI servers serve the Python applications while the web server handles tasks better suited for it such as static file serving, request routing, DDoS protection, and basic authentication.

* #### Templating

Instead of directly generating textual content from Python, the concept of separation of concerns advises us to use templates. A template engine manages a suite of template files, with a system of hierarchy and inclusion to avoid unnecessary repetition, and is in charge of rendering (generating) the actual content, filling the static content of the templates with the dynamic content generated by the application.

* #### Pylint

Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.
